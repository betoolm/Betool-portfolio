                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>The Yangtze River, one of the most polluted rivers globally, faces significant environmental challenges due to physical debris accumulation, threatening marine life, ecosystems, human health, and contributing to climate change. This project aimed to design an efficient Water Debris Collector while conducting a cost-benefit analysis to assess its economic impact and long-term feasibility.</p>
                    <p>Key Design Criteria include: Minimal Marine Life Disruption, Accessible Materials, Unobstructed Navigation, Ease of Manufacturing</p>

                    <h2>How?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineering Design: Used SOLIDWORKS to design the complete system, including a sheet metal electronics enclosure, weight sensor system, created BOM and other key components.</li>
                        <li>Prototyping: Created functional prototypes using cardboard and plastic to optimize component layouts and streamline the manufacturing process.</li>
                        <li>Filtration System: Designed a 30% more efficient water filtration system, improving debris separation while minimizing water flow disruption.</li>
                        <li>Design Studies: Conducted tolerance analysis, root cause analysis, and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to ensure system robustness.</li>
                        <li>Design of Experiments (DOE): Performed DOE-based testing to evaluate multiple design iterations and select the most effective configuration.</li>
                        <li>Project Presentation: Presented findings and design proposals to stakeholders, highlighting feasibility and sustainability.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The final Bank Filter with Guiding Vehicle system, modeled in SOLIDWORKS, consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autonomous Guiding Vehicles: Camera-equipped, debris-detecting units that patrol the river.</li>
                        <li>Bank Filter System: Filters positioned along the riverbanks to collect and separate debris.</li>
                        <li>Sensor Network: Cameras placed across the river to detect debris and trigger vehicle deployment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Upon detection, guiding vehicles direct plastic waste toward bank filters, where debris is extracted and filtered water is returned to the river. While the system requires higher initial investment, it offers lower maintenance costs and long-term environmental benefits, making it economically and environmentally viable.</p>
