            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project aimed to design and animate a fully operational snowmobile blade structure, leveraging SOLIDWORKS to achieve a synthesis of precision engineering and dynamic functionality tailored for extreme winter environments.</p>

            <h2>Task/Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Orchestrated project execution under stringent resource constraints, employing advanced project management methodologies to optimize timelines and deliverables.</li>
                <li>Developed over 100 precision components using SOLIDWORKS, producing detailed 3D models and 2D technical drawings with exacting dimensioning for seamless integration.</li>
                <li>Applied Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles, streamlining part designs to cut manufacturing costs by 10% while upholding structural robustness.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams—mechanical designers, materials scientists, and assembly technicians—to engineer a blade system, enhancing assembly consistency by 20%, reducing defective parts by 15%, and boosting throughput by 10% through iterative prototyping.</li>
                <li>Conducted rigorous failure mode analysis (FMA) and root-cause investigations, leveraging thermal and stress simulations to refine designs, ensuring resilience against operational stresses.</li>
                <li>Evaluated multifaceted impacts—safety compliance (ASME standards), environmental sustainability (recyclable alloys), and legal feasibility (patent considerations)—to deliver a deployable solution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Produced a blade system with 99.7% dimensional accuracy, validated through animation and physical testing, establishing a benchmark for reliability and performance in snowmobile engineering.</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> SOLIDWORKS, FEA Simulation, DFM Principles</p>
