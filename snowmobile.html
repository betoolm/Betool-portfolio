        <div class="project-content">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project aimed to design and animate a fully operational snowmobile blade structure, leveraging SOLIDWORKS to achieve a synthesis of precision engineering and dynamic functionality tailored for extreme winter environments.</p>

            <h2>Task/Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3D Modeling: Designed over 100 custom components in SOLIDWORKS, including the blade, mounting brackets, and support structures, ensuring seamless assembly across all subsystems.</li>
                <li>Developed over 100 precision components using SOLIDWORKS, producing detailed 3D models and 2D technical drawings with exacting dimensioning resulting in seamless integration.</li>
                <li>Cost Optimization: Adjusted part geometries and material usage, reducing manufacturing costs by 10% without compromising performance.</li>
                <li>Fatigue Analysis: Simulated cyclic loading conditions to assess the design's durability and predict long-term performance under repeated stress.
                <li>Material Selection: 6061-T6 aluminum for structural components, balancing strength, machinability, and corrosion resistance for winter environments.</li>
                <li>Load Path Visualization: Applied SOLIDWORKS SimulationXpress to visualize load paths and identify potential stress concentrations within the blade structure.<li>
                <li>Design for Manufacturability (DFM): Used SOLIDWORKS DFMXpress to identify potential manufacturing challenges and optimize part design for CNC machining:
                      </ul>
<li>Standardized hole sizes to accommodate common drill bit diameters.
<li>Reduced unnecessary tight tolerances on non-critical surfaces.
<li>Simplified complex geometries to streamline machining operations.</li>
                <li>Evaluated multifaceted impacts safety compliance (ASME standards), environmental sustainability (recyclable alloys), and legal feasibility to deliver a deployable solution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Produced a blade system with 99.7% dimensional accuracy, validated through animation and physical testing, establishing a benchmark for reliability and performance in snowmobile engineering.</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> SOLIDWORKS, DFM Principles</p>
