                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>The C-Wrist is a wearable wrist device designed to monitor vital signs for mild COVID-19 outpatients, reducing hospital capacity strain and promoting at-home care. The device continuously tracks body temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and motion, allowing patients to receive real-time health updates while performing daily activities.</p>
                    <p>By leveraging electrical device theory, sensor theory, and signal conditioning, this solution ensures early warning alerts when vitals deviate from safe thresholds, enabling timely intervention and preventing critical complications.</p>

                    <h2>How?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3D CAD Design: Created precise SOLIDWORKS models for the device housing, including soldering enclosures, button interfaces, hinges, and cable routing.</li>
                        <li>Sensor Integration: Utilized a SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor, an M5STACK NCIR Temperature Sensor, and an accelerometer for motion detection to enhance measurement accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Electronics & Programming: Used Arduino for sensor interfacing and Python for data processing, ensuring reliable real time monitoring and analysis.</li>
                        <li>Applied low-pass Butterworth filtering in Python to reduce noise in EMG and temperature signals.</li>
                        <li>Design Optimization: Conducted Design of Experiments (DOE) in Minitab to refine sensor placement and enclosure design, improving signal quality and user comfort.</li>
                        <li>Quality Assurance: Performed failure analysis, root cause analysis, and correction methods to enhance system durability and performance.</li>
                        <li>Project Management: Managed project budgets, delivered weekly progress reports, and ensured adherence to technical engineering standards.</li>
