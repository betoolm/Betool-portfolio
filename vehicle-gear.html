            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project engineered a high-precision gear and holder system for a snowmobile blade, blending cutting-edge simulation and rapid prototyping to redefine design optimization under extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Task/Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Directed a multidisciplinary effort to model over 100 intricate components in SolidWorks, generating precise 2D technical drawings and employing finite element analysis (FEA) to validate structural integrity under dynamic loads.</li>
                <li>Implemented Design for Manufacturability (DFM) strategies, optimizing part geometry and tolerances to reduce production costs by 10% while maintaining stringent quality standards.</li>
                <li>Led cross-functional collaboration with materials engineers and machinists to design a blade assembly system, integrating a novel kinematic alignment mechanism that improved assembly consistency by 25%, reduced part rejection rates by 20%, and increased throughput by 15%.</li>
                <li>Conducted comprehensive failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), identifying critical stress points via thermal and vibrational simulations, then iterating designs with advanced root-cause correction techniques to enhance durability.</li>
                <li>Performed a holistic impact assessment—spanning safety (ASME compliance), environmental (material recyclability), and legal (IP considerations)—to ensure the solution’s viability in real-world deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Achieved a fully functional blade system with 99.9% dimensional accuracy—lauded as “one of the most accurate designs” by peers—delivering unmatched reliability in harsh snowmobile environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> SolidWorks, FEA Simulation, DFM Principles</p>
