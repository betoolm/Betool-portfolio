                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>The Toilet Aid was designed to improve independence, hygiene, and accessibility for individuals with limited dexterity, mobility impairments, arthritis, or post-surgical recovery needs. The goal was to develop a low-cost, easy-to-use, and hygienic wiping aid that allows users to handle toilet paper independently. The design prioritized affordability (<$10 CAD), ease of use, hygiene, and ergonomic effectiveness, ensuring it can be widely adopted by elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and underserved communities. The device also complies with ISO 17966:2016, the standard for assistive devices for personal hygiene, ensuring safety, performance, and ease of use.</p>

                    <h2>How?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User Centered Design Approach: Conducted client validation meetings and consultations to refine design requirements based on grip strength, range of motion, and hygiene needs.</li>
                        <li>Material Selection & Cost Optimization: Identified kitchen tongs ($2-$6 CAD) as a readily available, cost effective base component.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Design Enhancements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom Handle Grip: Designed to improve ergonomics for users with reduced hand strength, ensuring a comfortable and firm grasp.</li>
                        <li>Adjustable Reach: Allows customization for various mobility needs, supporting users with shoulder, wrist, and finger limitations.</li>
                        <li>Locking Mechanism: Integrated to secure toilet paper during use, preventing accidental slippage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mechanical & Force Calculations: Maximum grip strength required: 25 N (as per ISO 17966:2016) was achieved.</li>
                        <li>Lever arm calculations ensured that users could apply sufficient force with minimal hand strength, reducing fatigue and maximizing efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Evaluated contact pressure and force distribution across the wiping surface to ensure sufficient pressure for proper hygiene.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted static stress, strain, and displacement simulations using ANSYS to validate structural integrity.</li>
                        <li>Confirmed that the design withstands multiple use cycles without mechanical failure.</li>
                        <li>Analyzed material deformation under repeated applied forces to ensure durability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gathered user feedback on ease of use, hygiene, and effectiveness, comparing various assistive tools like dish scrubbers, hangers, and toilet brushes.</li>
                    </ul>
