                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>The Portable Vision System was developed to enhance manual letter mail (LM) and packet sorting efficiency at Canada Post, addressing key operational challenges such as reducing knowledge sort dependency, improving processing performance (PPPH), minimizing missorts, and increasing accessibility for visually impaired employees. Given that manual letter mail comprises only 5-10% of total mail volume but accounts for 35-40% of used sorting hours, the system was designed to streamline workflows, reduce sorting errors, and improve overall service levels. Additionally, budget and market analysis were conducted to assess the project's feasibility and cost effectiveness.</p>
